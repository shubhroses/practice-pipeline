# DevSecOps Hackathon Project

## Problem Statement

Build and deploy a small web application using a virtualized Linux environment on macOS, with no access to public cloud platforms. The solution must demonstrate a complete DevSecOps pipeline including containerization, orchestration, and deployment automation.

## Solution Overview

This project implements a Flask web application deployed to a single-node Kubernetes cluster (k3s) running inside a Vagrant-managed Ubuntu VM. The entire stack runs locally and demonstrates modern DevSecOps practices including containerization, Infrastructure as Code, and automated deployment.
